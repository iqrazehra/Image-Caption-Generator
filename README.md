# Image-Caption-Generator
This repository implements an image caption generation system with two approaches: a pretrained VGG16 CNN for feature extraction coupled with an LSTM decoder, and Salesforceâ€™s BLIP-v1 model for zero-shot inference. It includes data download/preprocessing scripts, training/evaluation pipelines, inference utilities, and BLEU-1/2 and METEOR scoring.
